## Stow

  - `brew install stow` to get stow on a mac
  - the repo should be at `~/dotfiles` because stow will place the symlinks up one directory (and we want them in `~`)
  - cd into the repo, then `stow bash git vim` to install configurations in the bash, git, and vim directories.  Add any others you need.
